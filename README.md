# information extraction from patent cards

This is the code scripts for the information extraction from patent cards with 5 proprietary models and 1 local deployed Qwen2.5-vl-7B-instruct model. 
Special thanks to Xie et al's work. The code is mostly based on their pipeline @https://github.com/yuntingxie/patent_cards.
